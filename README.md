cvg_quadrotor_swarm
===================

We present a cost-effective framework for the prototyping of vision-based quadrotor multi-robot systems, which core characteristics are: modularity, compatibility with different platforms and being flight-proven. The framework is fully operative, which works in simulation and in real flight tests of up to 5 drones, and was demonstrated with the participation in the 2013 International Micro Air Vehicle Indoor Flight Competition (Toulouse, France).
